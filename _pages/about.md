I'm a Ph.D. student at NYU department of economics.

My interests are centered around mathematical and computational optimization and their application to economic theory and data science. Recently, I've been busy with computational optimal transport theory and its potential applications to mechanism design.

Previously, I was a Predoctoral Research Fellow at UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I worked on large-scale causal inference using genetic data. Before that, I was an auction design consultant at Cafe Bazaar, optimizing their online ad auctions. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology somewhere along the way.

Outside of work, I get overly excited by cats, cooking and baking, fantasy (unfortunately not LOTR), modern history (especially the Middle East), population genetics, mathematical logic, theory of computation, and foundations.
