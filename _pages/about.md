I'm a Predoctoral Research Fellow at UCLA Anderson School of Management working on genoeconomics with Daniel Benjamin and Alexander Young. Previously, I held the same position at USC and before that, I was a computer engineering student at the Sharif University of Technology. I did my dissertation on the algorithmic welfare maximization of Lightning Network, an off-chain solution to Bitcoin's scalability problem.

My interest spans a wide range of topics: from theory(both economics and computer science) to applied microeconomics and historical economics.
