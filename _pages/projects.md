<p>
snipar (single nucleotide imputation of parents) is a Python package for inferring identity-by-descent (IBD) segments shared between siblings, imputing missing parental genotypes, and for performing family based genome-wide association and polygenic score analyses using observed and/or imputed parental genotypes.

The imputation method and the family-based GWAS and polygenic score models are described in  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01085-0">Young et al. 2022</a>.
You can find the project <a href="https://github.com/AlexTISYoung/snipar">here</a>.
